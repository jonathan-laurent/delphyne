            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"
              - "z <= 0"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "3*x - 2*y >= 6"

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)"

          To prove the final assertion `x >= y`, we need to find invariants that hold throughout the loop and imply this assertion when the loop terminates.

          Let's analyze the loop:

          1. **Initial Values**:
             - `x` is initialized to 1.
             - `y` is initialized to 0.

          2. **Loop Body**:
             - `x` is updated to `x + y`.
             - `y` is incremented by 1.

          3. **Loop Guard**:
             - The loop runs while `y < 100000`.

          We need to find invariants that hold initially and are preserved by the loop body. The final assertion `x >= y` must be implied by these invariants when the loop terminates.

          ### Invariant Candidates:

          1. **Initial Invariants**:
             - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.
             - `y` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, so `y >= 0` is an invariant.

          2. **Preserving Invariants**:
             - Since `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `x` remains greater than or equal to `y` after each iteration.
             - We can observe that `x` is always increased by at least the current value of `y`, so `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` after each iteration.

          Given these observations, we propose the following invariants:

          - `x >= y`: This invariant holds initially and is preserved by the loop body because `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1.
          - `y >= 0`: This invariant holds initially and is preserved by the loop body because `y` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration.

          Answer:
          ```yaml
          - "x >= y"
          - "y >= 0"

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"
              - "z <= 0"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "3*x - 2*y >= 6"

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)"

              To prove the final assertion `x >= y`, we need to find invariants that hold throughout the loop and imply this assertion when the loop terminates.

              Let's analyze the loop:

              1. **Initial Values**:
                 - `x` is initialized to 1.
                 - `y` is initialized to 0.

              2. **Loop Body**:
                 - `x` is updated to `x + y`.
                 - `y` is incremented by 1.

              3. **Loop Guard**:
                 - The loop runs while `y < 100000`.

              We need to find invariants that hold initially and are preserved by the loop body. The final assertion `x >= y` must be implied by these invariants when the loop terminates.

              ### Invariant Candidates:

              1. **Initial Invariants**:
                 - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.
                 - `y` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, so `y >= 0` is an invariant.

              2. **Preserving Invariants**:
                 - Since `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `x` remains greater than or equal to `y` after each iteration.
                 - We can observe that `x` is always increased by at least the current value of `y`, so `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` after each iteration.

              Given these observations, we propose the following invariants:

              - `x >= y`: This invariant holds initially and is preserved by the loop body because `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1.
              - `y >= 0`: This invariant holds initially and is preserved by the loop body because `y` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration.

              Answer:
              ```yaml
              - "x >= y"
              - "y >= 0"

          The invariant `x >= y` does not hold during the first iteration of the loop. Indeed, `x` is 1 and `y` is 0 at the start of the loop. Thus, `x >= y` does not hold initially.

          However, `x >= y` is true at the end of the loop. Thus, we propose `x >= y || y < 100000` as an invariant. This invariant holds initially (because `y < 100000` is true) and is preserved by the loop body (because `x >= y` is true at the end of the loop).

            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)"

              To prove the final assertion `x >= y`, we need to find invariants that hold throughout the loop and imply this assertion when the loop terminates.

              Let's analyze the loop:

              1. **Initial Values**:
                 - `x` is initialized to 1.
                 - `y` is initialized to 0.

              2. **Loop Body**:
                 - `x` is updated to `x + y`.
                 - `y` is incremented by 1.

              3. **Loop Guard**:
                 - The loop runs while `y < 100000`.

              We need to find invariants that hold initially and are preserved by the loop body. The final assertion `x >= y` must be implied by these invariants when the loop terminates.

              ### Invariant Candidates:

              1. **Initial Invariants**:
                 - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.
                 - `y` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, so `y >= 0` is an invariant.

              2. **Preserving Invariants**:
                 - Since `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `x` remains greater than or equal to `y` after each iteration.
                 - We can observe that `x` is always increased by at least the current value of `y`, so `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` after each iteration.

              Given these observations, we propose the following invariants:

              - `x >= y`: This invariant holds initially and is preserved by the loop body because `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1.
              - `y >= 0`: This invariant holds initially and is preserved by the loop body because `y` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration.

              Answer:
              ```yaml
              - "x >= y"
              - "y >= 0"

              The invariant `x >= y` does not hold during the first iteration of the loop. Indeed, `x` is 1 and `y` is 0 at the start of the loop. Thus, `x >= y` does not hold initially.

              However, `x >= y` is true at the end of the loop. Thus, we propose `x >= y || y < 100000` as an invariant. This invariant holds initially (because `y < 100000` is true) and is preserved by the loop body (because `x >= y` is true at the end of the loop).

          The invariant `x >= y || y < 100000` is not preserved by the loop body. Indeed, when `y = 99999`, `x` is incremented by 99999 and `y` is incremented by 1. Thus, `x` is 100000 and `y` is 100000. Thus, `x >= y` is not true and `y < 100000` is not true. Thus, `x >= y || y < 100000` is not preserved.

          However, `x >= y` is true at the end of the loop. Thus, we propose `x - y >= 0 || y < 100000` as an invariant. This invariant holds initially (because `y < 100000` is true) and is preserved by the loop body (because `x - y` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by 1).

            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)"

              To prove the final assertion `x >= y`, we need to find invariants that hold throughout the loop and imply this assertion when the loop terminates.

              Let's analyze the loop:

              1. **Initial Values**:
                 - `x` is initialized to 1.
                 - `y` is initialized to 0.

              2. **Loop Body**:
                 - `x` is updated to `x + y`.
                 - `y` is incremented by 1.

              3. **Loop Guard**:
                 - The loop runs while `y < 100000`.

              We need to find invariants that hold initially and are preserved by the loop body. The final assertion `x >= y` must be implied by these invariants when the loop terminates.

              ### Invariant Candidates:

              1. **Initial Invariants**:
                 - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.
                 - `y` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, so `y >= 0` is an invariant.

              2. **Preserving Invariants**:
                 - Since `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `x` remains greater than or equal to `y` after each iteration.
                 - We can observe that `x` is always increased by at least the current value of `y`, so `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` after each iteration.

              Given these observations, we propose the following invariants:

              - `x >= y`: This invariant holds initially and is preserved by the loop body because `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1.
              - `y >= 0`: This invariant holds initially and is preserved by the loop body because `y` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration.

              Answer:
              ```yaml
              - "x >= y"
              - "y >= 0"

              The invariant `x >= y` does not hold during the first iteration of the loop. Indeed, `x` is 1 and `y` is 0 at the start of the loop. Thus, `x >= y` does not hold initially.

              However, `x >= y` is true at the end of the loop. Thus, we propose `x >= y || y < 100000` as an invariant. This invariant holds initially (because `y < 100000` is true) and is preserved by the loop body (because `x >= y` is true at the end of the loop).

              The invariant `x >= y || y < 100000` is not preserved by the loop body. Indeed, when `y = 99999`, `x` is incremented by 99999 and `y` is incremented by 1. Thus, `x` is 100000 and `y` is 100000. Thus, `x >= y` is not true and `y < 100000` is not true. Thus, `x >= y || y < 100000` is not preserved.

              However, `x >= y` is true at the end of the loop. Thus, we propose `x - y >= 0 || y < 100000` as an invariant. This invariant holds initially (because `y < 100000` is true) and is preserved by the loop body (because `x - y` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by 1).

              Answer:
              ```yaml
              - "x - y >= 0 || y < 100000"
              - "y >= 0"
              ```

          The issue is that `x - y >= 0` is not preserved by the loop body. Indeed, when `y = 99999`, `x` is incremented by 99999 and `y` is incremented by 1. Thus, `x` is 100000 and `y` is 100000. Thus, `x - y` is 0 and `y < 100000` is not true. Thus, `x - y >= 0 || y < 100000` is not preserved.

          However, `x >= y` is true at the end of the loop. Thus, we propose `x - y >= 1 || y < 100000` as an invariant. This invariant holds initially (because `y < 100000` is true) and is preserved by the loop body (because `x - y` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by 1).
