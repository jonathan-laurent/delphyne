            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you an annotated program in which Why3 did not manage to prove a particular assertion or invariant. Your task is to suggest a list of new invariant candidates that may unlock the proof.

            In order to help you diagnose the problem, I added comments to the WhyML program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`). The name of the failing proof obligation also provides a hint about the nature of the problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            Please suggest new invariant candidates. Each invariant candidate must be obtained by following one of the _tricks_ discussed below. A trick can be used multiple times. Do not suggest candidates that are already established invariants.

            Answer as a JSON object representing a list of `(trick_name, suggested_invariant)` pairs and **nothing else**.

            Examples are provided that include additional explanations for clarity. Do not include such explanations in your answer.


            ## Notes on Why3

            - The `any T` construct generates an arbitrary object of type `T`. In particular, a loop whose guard is `any bool` can run for an arbitrary number of times.


            ## Tricks

            Each trick is identified by a unique name. For each trick, we discuss *when* it is applicable and *what* the corresponding recipe is.

            ### propose_post

            If the final assertion fails to prove but appears to hold through the whole program, propose it as an invariant.

            ### monotone

            Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), propose invariant `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) for `c` some numerical constant.

            ### linear

            Whenever a linear equality or inequality between variables appears to hold throughout the program (e.g. `x - y >= 0`, `3*x + 2*y = 1`...), consider proposing it as an invariant.

            ### abduct_post

            If the final assertion fails to prove, look for a missing assumption that implies it when assuming all established invariants (along with the negation of the loop guard). Propose this assumption as a new invariant candidate.

            ### abduct_inv

            If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, look for a missing assumption and propose it as a new invariant.

            ### strengthen_inv

            If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, consider making it stronger (e.g proposing `x < y` as a replacement for `x <> y`).

            ### guard_inv

            If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.

            ### true_or_continue

            If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

            ### cond_guard

            If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

            ### relax_loop_guard

            Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

                - Since `z` is only decremented and starts at `0`, invariant `z <= 0` clearly holds. It is also likely to be useful since it shows that the conditional statement within the loop body always executes.
                - The post-condition `x <> y` is true initially. It is also preserved by the loop body since the conditional statement is always executed (and so both `x` and `y` are incremented at each iteration). Thus, proposing it as an invariant is reasonable.

              Explanations:
              - From the shown obligation, Why3 cannot prove that `x <> y` is preserved by the loop body. However, this is true since the conditional statement is always executed, and thus both `x` and `y` are incremented at each iteration. In turn, the conditional statement is always executed since `z` starts at `0` and is only decremented. This suggests adding `z <= 0` as an invariant.

                - `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

            ```

            The name of the proof obligation that failed is: `VC for main (assertion)`.

            Can you fix this by suggesting new invariant candidates?

            Just answer with a JSON object denoting a list of `(trick_name, invariant_candidate)` pairs and nothing else.

            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you an annotated program in which Why3 did not manage to prove a particular assertion or invariant. Your task is to suggest a list of new invariant candidates that may unlock the proof.

            In order to help you diagnose the problem, I added comments to the WhyML program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`). The name of the failing proof obligation also provides a hint about the nature of the problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            Please suggest new invariant candidates. Each invariant candidate must be obtained by following one of the _tricks_ discussed below. A trick can be used multiple times. Do not suggest candidates that are already established invariants.

            Answer as a JSON object representing a list of `(trick_name, suggested_invariant)` pairs and **nothing else**.

            Examples are provided that include additional explanations for clarity. Do not include such explanations in your answer.


            ## Notes on Why3

            - The `any T` construct generates an arbitrary object of type `T`. In particular, a loop whose guard is `any bool` can run for an arbitrary number of times.


            ## Tricks

            Each trick is identified by a unique name. For each trick, we discuss *when* it is applicable and *what* the corresponding recipe is.

            ### propose_post

            If the final assertion fails to prove but appears to hold through the whole program, propose it as an invariant.

            ### monotone

            Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), propose invariant `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) for `c` some numerical constant.

            ### linear

            Whenever a linear equality or inequality between variables appears to hold throughout the program (e.g. `x - y >= 0`, `3*x + 2*y = 1`...), consider proposing it as an invariant.

            ### abduct_post

            If the final assertion fails to prove, look for a missing assumption that implies it when assuming all established invariants (along with the negation of the loop guard). Propose this assumption as a new invariant candidate.

            ### abduct_inv

            If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, look for a missing assumption and propose it as a new invariant.

            ### strengthen_inv

            If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, consider making it stronger (e.g proposing `x < y` as a replacement for `x <> y`).

            ### guard_inv

            If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.

            ### true_or_continue

            If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

            ### cond_guard

            If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

            ### relax_loop_guard

            Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

            Here is the program that Why3 was tasked to verify.

            ```mlw
            use int.Int

            let example () diverges =  (* GOAL *)
              let ref x = any int in  (* premise *)
              let ref y = 3 in
              let ref z = 0 in
              assume { x < 0 };  (* premise *)
              while x < 10 do  (* premise *)
                x <- x + 1;
                z <- z - 1;
                if z < 0 then y <- y + 1
              done;
              assert { x <> y }  (* GOAL *)
            ```

            The name of the proof obligation that failed is: `VC for example (assertion)`.

            Can you fix this by suggesting new invariant candidates?

            Just answer with a JSON object denoting a list of `(trick_name, invariant_candidate)` pairs and nothing else.

              Explanations:
                - Since `z` is only decremented and starts at `0`, invariant `z <= 0` clearly holds. It is also likely to be useful since it shows that the conditional statement within the loop body always executes.
                - The post-condition `x <> y` is true initially. It is also preserved by the loop body since the conditional statement is always executed (and so both `x` and `y` are incremented at each iteration). Thus, proposing it as an invariant is reasonable.

              Explanations:
              - From the shown obligation, Why3 cannot prove that `x <> y` is preserved by the loop body. However, this is true since the conditional statement is always executed, and thus both `x` and `y` are incremented at each iteration. In turn, the conditional statement is always executed since `z` starts at `0` and is only decremented. This suggests adding `z <= 0` as an invariant.

              Explanations:
                - Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.
                - `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              Explanations:
                - We want to add an invariant that implies the final assertion `g >= 1`, assuming `n > 0` (the guard around the assertion) and `x >= n` (the negation of the loop guard). Suggesting `g >= 1` does not work since `g >= 1` does not hold initially. We propose trying the whole obligation itself as an invariant.

However, a useful assumption `n > 0` is made after the loop. Thus, I propose guarding the current candidate with it and suggesting `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant.

            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you an annotated program in which Why3 did not manage to prove a particular assertion or invariant. Your task is to suggest a list of new invariant candidates that may unlock the proof.

            In order to help you diagnose the problem, I added comments to the WhyML program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`). The name of the failing proof obligation also provides a hint about the nature of the problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            Please suggest new invariant candidates. Each invariant candidate must be obtained by following one of the _tricks_ discussed below. A trick can be used multiple times. Do not suggest candidates that are already established invariants.

            Answer as a JSON object representing a list of `(trick_name, suggested_invariant)` pairs and **nothing else**.

            Examples are provided that include additional explanations for clarity. Do not include such explanations in your answer.


            ## Notes on Why3

            - The `any T` construct generates an arbitrary object of type `T`. In particular, a loop whose guard is `any bool` can run for an arbitrary number of times.


            ## Tricks

            Each trick is identified by a unique name. For each trick, we discuss *when* it is applicable and *what* the corresponding recipe is.

            ### propose_post

            If the final assertion fails to prove but appears to hold through the whole program, propose it as an invariant.

            ### monotone

            Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), propose invariant `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) for `c` some numerical constant.

            ### linear

            Whenever a linear equality or inequality between variables appears to hold throughout the program (e.g. `x - y >= 0`, `3*x + 2*y = 1`...), consider proposing it as an invariant.

            ### abduct_post

            If the final assertion fails to prove, look for a missing assumption that implies it when assuming all established invariants (along with the negation of the loop guard). Propose this assumption as a new invariant candidate.

            ### abduct_inv

            If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, look for a missing assumption and propose it as a new invariant.

            ### strengthen_inv

            If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, consider making it stronger (e.g proposing `x < y` as a replacement for `x <> y`).

            ### guard_inv

            If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.

            ### true_or_continue

            If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

            ### cond_guard

            If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

            ### relax_loop_guard

            Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

            ```mlw

            let example () diverges =  (* GOAL *)
              let ref x = any int in  (* premise *)
              let ref y = 3 in
              let ref z = 0 in
              assume { x < 0 };  (* premise *)
              while x < 10 do  (* premise *)
                x <- x + 1;
                z <- z - 1;
                if z < 0 then y <- y + 1
              done;
              assert { x <> y }  (* GOAL *)
            ```

              Explanations:
                - Since `z` is only decremented and starts at `0`, invariant `z <= 0` clearly holds. It is also likely to be useful since it shows that the conditional statement within the loop body always executes.
                - The post-condition `x <> y` is true initially. It is also preserved by the loop body since the conditional statement is always executed (and so both `x` and `y` are incremented at each iteration). Thus, proposing it as an invariant is reasonable.

              Explanations:
              - From the shown obligation, Why3 cannot prove that `x <> y` is preserved by the loop body. However, this is true since the conditional statement is always executed, and thus both `x` and `y` are incremented at each iteration. In turn, the conditional statement is always executed since `z` starts at `0` and is only decremented. This suggests adding `z <= 0` as an invariant.

              Explanations:
                - Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.
                - `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              Explanations:
                - We want to add an invariant that implies the final assertion `g >= 1`, assuming `n > 0` (the guard around the assertion) and `x >= n` (the negation of the loop guard). Suggesting `g >= 1` does not work since `g >= 1` does not hold initially. We propose trying the whole obligation itself as an invariant.

                - The user tried to prove `g >= 1` as an invariant but it does not hold initially. Still, it always hold after an iteration of the loop since the loop body sets `g` to 4. Thus, I am proposing to try invariant `g >= 1 || x < n` instead.

                - The user tried to prove `g >= 1 || x < n` as an invariant but it does not hold initially. Indeed, no assumption about `n` is known initially. However, a useful assumption `n > 0` is made after the loop. Thus, I propose guarding the current candidate with it and suggesting `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant.
