            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"
              - "z <= 0"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)"

          Let's analyze the program:

          - Initially, `sn` is 0 and `i` is 1.
          - The loop runs while `i <= n`.
          - Each loop iteration increments `i` by 1 and increments `sn` by 1.
          - After the loop ends, if `sn <> n`, then the assertion `sn = 0` must hold.

          We need to find invariants that ensure the assertion is true.

          Observations:

          - The loop increments both `i` and `sn` by 1 at each iteration.
          - Initially, `i = 1` and `sn = 0`.
          - The loop continues while `i <= n`.
          - At each iteration, since `i` increments from 1 up to `n+1`, `sn` increments from 0 up to `n`.
          - Because `i > n` at loop end, we have `i == n + 1` after the loop terminates.
          - Therefore, `sn` should be equal to `n` at the end of the loop.

          Let me check whether `sn = n` is an invariant.

          - Initially, `sn = 0` and `i = 1`, so `sn = i - 1` holds initially.
          - After incrementing, `i` becomes `i + 1` and `sn` becomes `sn + 1`.
          - If `sn = i - 1` holds before the iteration, then after the iteration `sn + 1 = (i + 1) - 1 = i`.
          - So `sn = i - 1` is preserved.

          Thus, the invariant `sn = i - 1` holds at every step.

          Next, we want to prove the assertion `if sn <> n then sn = 0`.

          We can check the loop exit condition `not (i <= n)`, so `i > n`. Using the invariant, `sn = i - 1 > n - 1`.

          - If `i > n`, then `i - 1 >= n`.
          - So `sn = i - 1 >= n`.
          - Since `sn` is an integer, if `i > n` implies `sn >= n`.
          - But since `sn` increments by 1 at every step and `i` increments by 1, there's no way for `sn` to be less than `n` if `i > n`.

          In particular, since `i` starts at 1 and ends at `n + 1` after the loop, `sn = n` at the end.

          So `sn <> n` can only be true if the loop never runs, i.e., if `i > n` initially. Since `i = 1`, and the loop test is `i <= n`, the loop never runs only if `n < 1`.

          In that case, `sn` is `0` at the end.

          Thus, if `sn <> n` (loop did not run because `n < 1`), then `sn = 0`.

          This suggests the implication `sn <> n -> sn = 0` holds given the invariant `sn = i - 1` and loop guard conditions.

          Also, we have that `i` starts at 1, so if `n < 1`, loop body never executes.

          Therefore, our invariants are:

          - `sn = i - 1` (connects values of `sn` and `i` precisely)
          - `i >= 1` (established since `i` is incremented and starts at 1)
          - `i <= n + 1` (since loop goes while `i <= n`, stops when `i = n + 1`)

          These invariants together imply the assertion.

          Answer:
          ```
          - "sn = i - 1"
          - "i >= 1"
          - "i <= n + 1"

            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"
              - "z <= 0"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```

              Let's analyze the program:

              - Initially, `sn` is 0 and `i` is 1.
              - The loop runs while `i <= n`.
              - Each loop iteration increments `i` by 1 and increments `sn` by 1.
              - After the loop ends, if `sn <> n`, then the assertion `sn = 0` must hold.

              We need to find invariants that ensure the assertion is true.

              Observations:

              - The loop increments both `i` and `sn` by 1 at each iteration.
              - Initially, `i = 1` and `sn = 0`.
              - The loop continues while `i <= n`.
              - At each iteration, since `i` increments from 1 up to `n+1`, `sn` increments from 0 up to `n`.
              - Because `i > n` at loop end, we have `i == n + 1` after the loop terminates.
              - Therefore, `sn` should be equal to `n` at the end of the loop.

              Let me check whether `sn = n` is an invariant.

              - Initially, `sn = 0` and `i = 1`, so `sn = i - 1` holds initially.
              - After incrementing, `i` becomes `i + 1` and `sn` becomes `sn + 1`.
              - If `sn = i - 1` holds before the iteration, then after the iteration `sn + 1 = (i + 1) - 1 = i`.
              - So `sn = i - 1` is preserved.

              Thus, the invariant `sn = i - 1` holds at every step.

              Next, we want to prove the assertion `if sn <> n then sn = 0`.

              We can check the loop exit condition `not (i <= n)`, so `i > n`. Using the invariant, `sn = i - 1 > n - 1`.

              - If `i > n`, then `i - 1 >= n`.
              - So `sn = i - 1 >= n`.
              - Since `sn` is an integer, if `i > n` implies `sn >= n`.
              - But since `sn` increments by 1 at every step and `i` increments by 1, there's no way for `sn` to be less than `n` if `i > n`.

              In particular, since `i` starts at 1 and ends at `n + 1` after the loop, `sn = n` at the end.

              So `sn <> n` can only be true if the loop never runs, i.e., if `i > n` initially. Since `i = 1`, and the loop test is `i <= n`, the loop never runs only if `n < 1`.

              In that case, `sn` is `0` at the end.

              Thus, if `sn <> n` (loop did not run because `n < 1`), then `sn = 0`.

              This suggests the implication `sn <> n -> sn = 0` holds given the invariant `sn = i - 1` and loop guard conditions.

              Also, we have that `i` starts at 1, so if `n < 1`, loop body never executes.

              Therefore, our invariants are:

              - `sn = i - 1` (connects values of `sn` and `i` precisely)
              - `i >= 1` (established since `i` is incremented and starts at 1)
              - `i <= n + 1` (since loop goes while `i <= n`, stops when `i = n + 1`)

              These invariants together imply the assertion.

          The failing obligation concerns the initialization (loop invariant init) of the invariant `i <= n + 1`. It is not guaranteed to be true initially:

          - `i` is set to 1.
          - `n` is an arbitrary integer (could be any int).
          - The invariant `i <= n + 1` must hold initially, so `1 <= n + 1` or equivalently `n >= 0` must hold.
          - But `n` may be less than 0, so this invariant does not hold initially.

          Therefore, we must weaken this invariant so it holds initially and is preserved.

          Since the loop guard is `i <= n`, and `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 up to `n + 1`, but if `n < 0`, the loop never executes.

          We can try instead:

          - The invariant `i <= n + 1 || n < 0` would hold initially because if `n < 0` then `i <= n + 1` is irrelevant.
          - Also, this formula is preserved by the loop (since if `i <= n + 1` holds before iteration, then it also holds after incrementing `i` by 1 and given that the loop guard is `i <= n`).
          - Thus, propose invariant `i <= n + 1 || n < 0`.

          However, we must keep to linear arithmetic expressions; logical operations are okay.

          Alternatively, this can be rewritten as `n < 0 || i <= n + 1`.

          Hence, the list of invariants is adjusted:

          - `sn = i - 1`
          - `i >= 1`
          - `n < 0 || i <= n + 1`

          This invariant holds initially because:

          - If `n < 0` then the invariant holds regardless of `i`.
          - If `n >= 0`, then `1 <= n + 1` because `n + 1 >= 1` and `i = 1`, so `i <= n + 1`.

          Also, preservation holds because:

          - The loop only runs if `i <= n`, and incrementing `i` by one, `i + 1 <= n + 1` remains valid.

          Answer:
          ```
          - "sn = i - 1"
          - "i >= 1"
          - "n < 0 || i <= n + 1"

            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"
              - "z <= 0"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```

              Let's analyze the program:

              - Initially, `sn` is 0 and `i` is 1.
              - The loop runs while `i <= n`.
              - Each loop iteration increments `i` by 1 and increments `sn` by 1.
              - After the loop ends, if `sn <> n`, then the assertion `sn = 0` must hold.

              We need to find invariants that ensure the assertion is true.

              Observations:

              - The loop increments both `i` and `sn` by 1 at each iteration.
              - Initially, `i = 1` and `sn = 0`.
              - The loop continues while `i <= n`.
              - At each iteration, since `i` increments from 1 up to `n+1`, `sn` increments from 0 up to `n`.
              - Because `i > n` at loop end, we have `i == n + 1` after the loop terminates.
              - Therefore, `sn` should be equal to `n` at the end of the loop.

              Let me check whether `sn = n` is an invariant.

              - Initially, `sn = 0` and `i = 1`, so `sn = i - 1` holds initially.
              - After incrementing, `i` becomes `i + 1` and `sn` becomes `sn + 1`.
              - If `sn = i - 1` holds before the iteration, then after the iteration `sn + 1 = (i + 1) - 1 = i`.
              - So `sn = i - 1` is preserved.

              Thus, the invariant `sn = i - 1` holds at every step.

              Next, we want to prove the assertion `if sn <> n then sn = 0`.

              We can check the loop exit condition `not (i <= n)`, so `i > n`. Using the invariant, `sn = i - 1 > n - 1`.

              - If `i > n`, then `i - 1 >= n`.
              - So `sn = i - 1 >= n`.
              - Since `sn` is an integer, if `i > n` implies `sn >= n`.
              - But since `sn` increments by 1 at every step and `i` increments by 1, there's no way for `sn` to be less than `n` if `i > n`.

              In particular, since `i` starts at 1 and ends at `n + 1` after the loop, `sn = n` at the end.

              So `sn <> n` can only be true if the loop never runs, i.e., if `i > n` initially. Since `i = 1`, and the loop test is `i <= n`, the loop never runs only if `n < 1`.

              In that case, `sn` is `0` at the end.

              Thus, if `sn <> n` (loop did not run because `n < 1`), then `sn = 0`.

              This suggests the implication `sn <> n -> sn = 0` holds given the invariant `sn = i - 1` and loop guard conditions.

              Also, we have that `i` starts at 1, so if `n < 1`, loop body never executes.

              Therefore, our invariants are:

              - `sn = i - 1` (connects values of `sn` and `i` precisely)
              - `i >= 1` (established since `i` is incremented and starts at 1)
              - `i <= n + 1` (since loop goes while `i <= n`, stops when `i = n + 1`)

              These invariants together imply the assertion.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "sn = i - 1"
              - "i >= 1"
              - "i <= n + 1"

              The failing obligation concerns the initialization (loop invariant init) of the invariant `i <= n + 1`. It is not guaranteed to be true initially:

              - `i` is set to 1.
              - `n` is an arbitrary integer (could be any int).
              - The invariant `i <= n + 1` must hold initially, so `1 <= n + 1` or equivalently `n >= 0` must hold.
              - But `n` may be less than 0, so this invariant does not hold initially.

              Therefore, we must weaken this invariant so it holds initially and is preserved.

              Since the loop guard is `i <= n`, and `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 up to `n + 1`, but if `n < 0`, the loop never executes.

              We can try instead:

              - The invariant `i <= n + 1 || n < 0` would hold initially because if `n < 0` then `i <= n + 1` is irrelevant.
              - Also, this formula is preserved by the loop (since if `i <= n + 1` holds before iteration, then it also holds after incrementing `i` by 1 and given that the loop guard is `i <= n`).
              - Thus, propose invariant `i <= n + 1 || n < 0`.

              However, we must keep to linear arithmetic expressions; logical operations are okay.

              Alternatively, this can be rewritten as `n < 0 || i <= n + 1`.

              Hence, the list of invariants is adjusted:

              - `sn = i - 1`
              - `i >= 1`
              - `n < 0 || i <= n + 1`

              This invariant holds initially because:

              - If `n < 0` then the invariant holds regardless of `i`.
              - If `n >= 0`, then `1 <= n + 1` because `n + 1 >= 1` and `i = 1`, so `i <= n + 1`.

              Also, preservation holds because:

              - The loop only runs if `i <= n`, and incrementing `i` by one, `i + 1 <= n + 1` remains valid.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "sn = i - 1"

          Let's analyze the situation at the end of the loop based on the invariants and assumptions.

          We have the loop and invariants:
          - `sn = i - 1`
          - `i >= 1`
          - `n < 0 || i <= n + 1`

          At the end of the loop the guard `i <= n` is false, so:

          - `i > n`

          From this and the invariant `sn = i - 1`, it follows that:

          - `sn = i - 1 >= n`

          Hence, `sn >= n`.

          The assertion is:

          - If `sn <> n` then `sn = 0`.

          Our goal is to prove this.

          Since we have established `sn >= n`.

          Case 1: `sn = n` - assertion does not require anything.

          Case 2: `sn <> n` => then `sn > n` (since `sn >= n`).

          Our invariant and the loop termination condition imply `i > n`.

          Therefore, `sn = i - 1 >= n + 1`.

          Given that the loop body increments `sn` by 1 each iteration, and `sn` was 0 initially, which means:

          - `sn` is at least 0.

          But could `sn` be non-zero and `sn <> n`?

          Because `sn` increments exactly once per loop iteration starting from 0, and since the loop increments `i` starting from 1, `sn` counts exactly how many times the loop executed.

          If the loop executed, then `sn = n`.

          If loop did not execute, then `sn = 0`.

          The only possibility for `sn <> n` is no loop iteration (e.g., when `n < 1`), in which case `sn = 0`.

          But we did not explicitly relate `n` with the loop run or not.

          Hence, to address this problem, let's add the invariant:

          - `n < 1 -> sn = 0` (if `n < 1` then loop does not run and `sn` remains 0).

          Then, at the loop end:

          - If `sn <> n` then either the loop did not run because `n < 1` so `sn = 0` or the loop ran and then `sn = n`.

          Thus, adding the invariant `n < 1 -> sn = 0` helps prove the assertion.

          Therefore, new list of invariants:

          - `sn = i - 1`
          - `i >= 1`
          - `n < 0 || i <= n + 1`
          - `n < 1 -> sn = 0`

          All invariants are linear combinations of linear arithmetic expressions.

          Answer:
          ```
          - "sn = i - 1"
          - "i >= 1"
          - "n < 0 || i <= n + 1"
          - "n < 1 -> sn = 0"
          ```
