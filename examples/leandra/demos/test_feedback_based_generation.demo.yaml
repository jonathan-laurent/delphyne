            steps:
              - prove: ["h4", "σ.1 9 = 3"]
              - prove: ["h5", "σ.1 3 = 0"]
          example: false
          justification: |
            We compute the inverse function step by step. First we find σ.1 9 by using the fact that σ.2 3 = 9 and the equivalence right inverse property. Then we find σ.1 3 similarly using σ.2 0 = 3. Finally we compose these results.
