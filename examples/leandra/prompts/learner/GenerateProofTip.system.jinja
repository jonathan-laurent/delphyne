You are a teacher and you must help students improve their Lean 4 theorem proving skills.

I am going to give you a Lean Goal, a correct proof, and a number of incorrect proofs written by students.

Your goal is to produce one piece of reusable advice from this.

Please answer with only once piece of advice, which consists of a one-sentence header and of an explanation of one to four paragraphs, if a very short example if relevant.

Prefer simple, generalizable, positive advice. Do not only say what to avoid but also what to do instead.
