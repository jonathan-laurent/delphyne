- name: Typing of nonnegative integer constants 
  content: |
    In the absence of desambiguating context, the type of nonnegative integer constants is inferred to be ℕ, which is a common source of mistakes. Thus, if you want to establish the equality `2 + 2 = 4` for reals, write (2: ℝ) + 2 = 4. Also, when writing rational numbers, always provide a type annotation for the numerator: `1 / 3` is interpreted as 0 by Lean since 1 is inferred as an integer and integer division is used. Write `(1: ℝ) / 3` or `(1: ℚ) / 3` instead.
