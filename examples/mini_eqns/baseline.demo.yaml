        The equality can be derived as follows:
        ```
        cos(pi/3)
        = cos(pi/2-pi/6)
        = sin(pi/6)
        ```

        However, the second step uses property `cos(pi/2-x) = sin(x)`, which is not part of the allowed set of rules. Thus, we provide a longer derivation that uses `cos_add`.

        ```
        cos(pi/2-pi/6)
        = cos(pi/2+(-pi/6))
        = cos(pi/2)*cos(-pi/6) - sin(pi/2)*sin(-pi/6)
        = -sin(-pi/6)
        = sin(pi/6)
        ```

        The second step uses that `cos(pi/2) = 0` and `sin(pi/2)` = 1, which we can get via the `sin_halfpi` and `cos_halfpi` rules. The last step uses `sin_neg`, so we should be done. Let's formalize this reasoning as a proof.

        ```yaml
        # We start establishing `cos(pi/2-pi/6) = sin(pi/6)`
        1:
          - ["cos(pi/2-pi/6)", "cos(pi/2)*cos(-pi/6) - sin(pi/2)*sin(-pi/6)"]
          - {rule: cos_add, vars: {x: "pi/2", y: "-pi/6"}}
        2:
          - ["cos(pi/2)*cos(-pi/6) - sin(pi/2)*sin(-pi/6)", "-sin(pi/2)*sin(-pi/6)"]
          - {rule: cos_halfpi, vars: {}}
        3:
          - ["-sin(pi/2)*sin(-pi/6)", "-sin(-pi/6)"]
          - {rule: sin_halfpi, vars: {}}
        4:
          - ["-sin(-pi/6)", "sin(pi/6)"]
          - {rule: sin_neg, vars: {x: "pi/6"}}
        5:
          - ["cos(pi/2-pi/6)", "sin(pi/6)"]
          - {trans: [1, 2, 3, 4]}

        # We establish our main result.
        # Step 5 applies directly since "cos(pi/3)" and "cos(pi/2-pi/6)" are treated as identical by the rule matcher, which performs simple simplification (as long as the required simplification does not require trigonometry).
        6:
          - ["cos(pi/3)", "sin(pi/6)"]
          - {step: 5}
        ```

        It is easier to start with the right-hand side here:

        ```
        sin(x)
        = sin(x/2+x/2)
        = sin(x/2)*cos(x/2) + cos(x/2)*sin(x/2)
        = 2*sin(x/2)*cos(x/2)
        ```

        The first and last steps are just elementary simplifications so the only real rule to apply here is `sin_add`.

        ```yaml
        1:
          - ["sin(x)", "2*sin(x/2)*cos(x/2)"]
          - {rule: sin_add, vars: {x: "x/2", y: "x/2"}}
        2:
          - ["2*sin(x/2)*cos(x/2)", "sin(x)"]
          - {sym: 1}
        ```
