"""
The Search Stream Protocol.

In order to allow the composition of heterogeneous search policies and
prompting policies, a standard protocol is defined for defining
resource-aware search iterators.

A search stream consists in an iterator that yields three kinds of
messages:

- `Solution` messages indicating that a solution has been found.
- `Barrier` messages asking authorization to spend a given amount of
  resources (for which an over-estimate is provided).
- `Spent` messages reporting actual resource spending.

The following invariants and guarantees must be offered and preserved by
stream combinators:

**Invariants**

- `Barrier` and `Spent` messages come in pairs and are associated
  using shared identifiers. Because search streams can spawn mulitple
  threads internally, multiple `Barrier` messages can be simultaneously
  pending (i.e., in waiting of a matching `Spent` message).
- A stream must eventually terminate if all spending requests are denied
  (this is why `loop` has a `stop_on_reject` argument).
- A stream can be interrupted before exhaustion (and be later garbage
  collected), provided that no `Barrier` messages are pending (i.e., an
  identical number of `Barrier` and `Spent` messages has been seen so
  far). If this condition does not hold, some actual resource spending
  might be unreported.

!!! warning
    Manually implementing the search stream protocol by yielding
    `Barrier` and `Spent` messages is error-prone. Standard stream
    combinators should usually be used instead (see `Stream` class from
    the standard library).
