    Abstract type for a tree node.

    New effects can be added to the strategy language by subclassing
    `Node` and then defining a triggering function that calls the
    `spawn` class method (manually defining such a wrapper allows
    providing users with precise type annotations: i.e., `branch` for
    `Branch`).

    **Methods to override:**

    - The `navigate` method must be overriden for all node types.
    - The `leaf_node` method must be overriden for all leaf nodes.
    - The following methods are also frequently overriden:
        `summary_message`, `valid_action`, `primary_space`, and
        `get_extra_tags`.

    Other methods are implemented via inspection and are not typically
    overriden.

    ??? note "On the absence of type parameters"
        In order to precisely type the fields of node subclasses (e.g.
        `Branch`), `Node` would need to have type parameters standing
        for the surrounding inner policy type, the action type, etc.
        However, Python's type system is not expressive enough to
        properly constrain such type parameters in the definition of
        trees since it lacks GADTs and higher-kinded types. In
        particular, the way we express signatures as unions of subtypes
        of `Node` would not work if `Node` were parametric.

        As a result, types such as inner policy types and action types
        must be represented using `Any` in the definition of nodes (e.g.
        `Branch`) and the type safety of search policy implementations
        (e.g. `dfs`) cannot be fully enforced statically. However,
        effect *triggering functions* such as `branch` can typically be
        typed precisely, providing static type safety for strategy
        writers.

    A strategy tree can be obtained by reifying a strategy computation

    associated inner policy type `P`, and a return type `T`.

    Trees are **immutable**.
