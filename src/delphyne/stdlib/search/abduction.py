    """
    A saturation-based, sequential policy for abduction trees.

    This policy proceeds by saturation: it repeatedly grows a set of
    proved facts until the main goal is proved or some limit is reached.

    It does so by repeatedly performing _rollouts_. Each rollout starts
    with the toplevel goal as a target, and attempts to prove this target
    assuming all facts in `proved`. If the target cannot be proved,
    suggestions for auxiliary facts to prove first are requested before
    another attempt is made. If still unsuccessful, one of the unproved
    suggestions is set as the new target and the rollout proceeds (up to
    some depth specified by `max_rollout_depth`).

    The algorithm maintains four, disjoint global sets of facts:

    - `proved`: facts that have been successfully proved
    - `disproved`: facts that have been disproved
    - `redundant`: facts that are implied by the conjunction of all
      facts from `proved`.
    - `candidates`: facts that have been suggested but do not belong to
      any of the three sets above.

    Each step of a rollout proceeds as follows:

    - The current target is assumed to be a fact from the `candidates`
      set. Suggestions for new rollout targets are determined as follows
      (`get_suggestions`):
        - The `suggest` node function returns a list of candidates.
        - All suggestions are normalized using the `search_equivalent`
          node function (one call per suggestion).
        - Each normalized suggestion is added (`add_candidate`) to one
          of the `proved`, `disproved`, `redundant`, or `candidates`
          sets. At most one call to the `prove` and `is_redundant` node
          functions is made per suggestion.
        - Assuming the previous step results in at least one new fact
          being proved, all candidates from the `candidates` set are
          re-examined until saturation (`saturate`).
        - Remaining suggestions that are in `candidates` are potential
          taregts for the next rollout step.
    - Assuming the current target is still not proved, the next rollout
      target is picked using the `scoring_function` parameter.

    Arguments:
        max_rollout_depth: The maximum depth of a rollout, as the
            maximal number of consecutive target goals that can be set
            (the first goal being the toplevel goal).
        scoring_function: Scoring function for choosing the next target
            goal at the end of each rollout step.
        log_steps: If not `None`, log main steps of the algorithm at the
            provided severity level.
        max_raw_suggestions_per_step: Maximum number of suggestions from
            the `suggest` node function to consider at each rollout
            step. If more suggestions are available, the most frequent
            (for naive, syntacic equality) ones are chosen.
        max_reattempted_candidates_per_propagation_step: Maximum number
            of candidates that are reattempted at each propagation step.
            Candidates that have been proposed more frequently are
            selected in priority.
        max_consecutive_propagation_steps: Maximum number of propagation
            steps that are performed during a rollout step, or `None` if
            there is no limit.
        max_proved: The maximum number of proved facts that can be
            accumulated. Search fails if this number is exceeded without
            the top-level goal being proved. In particular, setting such
            a limit is useful for bounding the complexity of `prove`,
            `search_equivalent` and `is_redundant`.
        max_candidates: The maximum number of unproved fact candidates
            that can be memorized. Once this number is met, new
            suggestions are not memorized if they cannot be proved
            straight away. In particular, setting such a limit is useful
            for bounding the complexity of `search_equivalent`.
        remember_disproved: Whether or not to remember disproved facts
            so that one does not attempt to prove them again. In
            particular, not remembering disproved facts is useful for
            bounding the complexity of `search_equivalent`.

    !!! warning
        Facts must be hashable.

    !!! warning
        By design, this policy tries and makes as few calls to `suggest`
        as possible, since those typically involve LLM calls. However,
        by default, it can make a very large number of calls to `prove`,
        `is_redundant` and `search_equivalent`. This number can explode
        as the number of candidates increases (in particular, it can be
        quadratic in the number of candidates at each rollout step, due
        to saturation). Thus, we recommend setting proper limits using
        the hyperparameters whose name start with `max_`.

    !!! tip
        Possible suggestions are auxiliary facts, but also repair
        suggestions. For example, suppose the goal is to prove `x > 0`,
        which is false. Then, one might suggest a repair such as `n > 0
        -> x > 0`.

    !!! note
        No fact is attempted to be proved if it is redundant with
        already-proved facts. However, in the current implementation,
        the set of proved facts can still contain redundancy. For
        example, if `x > 0` is established before the stronger `x >= 0`
        is, the former won't be deleted.
