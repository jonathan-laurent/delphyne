          Jonathan Laurent's favorite dish is a classic French ratatouille. This hearty vegetable stew features a vibrant mix of seasonal vegetables such as eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, and garlic, all slowly simmered with herbs like thyme and basil. It's typically served warm and enjoyed as a comforting and nutritious meal.
