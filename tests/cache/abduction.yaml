            You are in a market and you are presented with a list of sellers.
            Each seller offers to exchange a specific item for a list of other
            items (or for free if the list is empty). You also possess a number
            of items and are interested in obtaining a new one.

            Find all vendors selling the item that you want and answer with a
            list of all the things these vendors want that you do not have
            already.
